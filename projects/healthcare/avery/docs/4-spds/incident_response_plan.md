# Incident Response Plan

## Function

Incidents.


## Classification note

Avery is an **institutional executive agent**, not software as a medical device. Healthcare overlay documents in this set exist to **prevent clinical overclaim**, not to register a device.

## Epistemic discipline

Separate FACT, DECISION, ASSUMPTION, HYPOTHESIS, UNKNOWN, DISPUTED, and SUPERSEDED. Chat and Git history are context, not operational truth.

## Authority

Chief (dr. Ferdi Iskandar) is the human authority of record. Agents execute inside `autonomy_envelope.md`.


If session leak: unpair WhatsApp, rotate model keys, treat number as compromised. If prompt-injection: snapshot logs (redact), tighten allowlist, notify Chief. If clinical overclaim: halt feature, correct SOUL/skills, notify Chief.

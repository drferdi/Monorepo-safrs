# AI Incident Plan

## Function

AI incidents.


## Classification note

Avery is an **institutional executive agent**, not software as a medical device. Healthcare overlay documents in this set exist to **prevent clinical overclaim**, not to register a device.

## Epistemic discipline

Separate FACT, DECISION, ASSUMPTION, HYPOTHESIS, UNKNOWN, DISPUTED, and SUPERSEDED. Chat and Git history are context, not operational truth.

## Authority

Chief (dr. Ferdi Iskandar) is the human authority of record. Agents execute inside `autonomy_envelope.md`.


Harmful outbound: stop gateway, preserve redacted logs, notify Chief, tighten policy. Model jailbreak: same. Wrong clinical advice: treat as safety incident even though product is not SaMD.

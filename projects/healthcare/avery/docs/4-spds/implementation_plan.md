# Implementation Plan

## Function

What to implement vs already present.


## Classification note

Avery is an **institutional executive agent**, not software as a medical device. Healthcare overlay documents in this set exist to **prevent clinical overclaim**, not to register a device.

## Epistemic discipline

Separate FACT, DECISION, ASSUMPTION, HYPOTHESIS, UNKNOWN, DISPUTED, and SUPERSEDED. Chat and Git history are context, not operational truth.

## Authority

Chief (dr. Ferdi Iskandar) is the human authority of record. Agents execute inside `autonomy_envelope.md`.


**Present:** profile, skills, ops scripts, outbound package, console, deploy sketches, tests.

**Not present as product:** Maestro control plane, rate limiting, result-validation framework, multi-channel (see `capabilities.json` `not_yet`).

Do not implement `not_yet` items unless Chief assigns them.

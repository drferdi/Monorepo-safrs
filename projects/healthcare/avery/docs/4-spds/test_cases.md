# Test Cases

## Function

Cases.


## Classification note

Avery is an **institutional executive agent**, not software as a medical device. Healthcare overlay documents in this set exist to **prevent clinical overclaim**, not to register a device.

## Epistemic discipline

Separate FACT, DECISION, ASSUMPTION, HYPOTHESIS, UNKNOWN, DISPUTED, and SUPERSEDED. Chat and Git history are context, not operational truth.

## Authority

Chief (dr. Ferdi Iskandar) is the human authority of record. Agents execute inside `autonomy_envelope.md`.


Canonical cases live in `tests/` as unittest. Do not duplicate them here. This file points maintainers to execute `scripts/test.ps1` from the capsule/monorepo path documented in AGENTS.md.
